    "\n",
    "This data science project will focus on the city of Hamburg, Germany. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hamburg is one of the largest cities in Germany, an industry hub in the north of the country, and a desired place to live and work for many, especially young people such as students. With these advantages, however, come comparably high rents. Looking for a place to live in Hamburg requires one to look at several variables to make a reasonable choice: \n",
    "\n",
    "  * First of all, where can one afford to rent an appartment? \n",
    "  * Second, which areas cover ones personal interests best? A nature-loving person might like to live in the vincinity of parks and trails, while others might enjoy a neighbourhood with plenty of restaurants and bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will analyze neighbourhoods in Hamburg in regards to rent per square meter and popular venues. Primary stakeholders who would be interested in this data are:\n",
    "  * people house-/appartment-hunting \n",
    "  * realtors, who can use the data to define areas best matching the demands of their clients\n",
    "  \n",
    "Providing an compact and easy-to-understand dataset characterizing Hamburg neighbourhoods would provide these stakeholders with a foundation to quickly determine target neighbourhoods for their search and avoid them wasting time searching through the whole city.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Furthermore, there are secondary stakeholders who also might find the analysis interesting: for example, city officials could use the visualization to find areas that would benefit the most from additional housing projects or additional public recreational areas. Entrepreneurs that plan to open a certain type of service could use the data to find areas where this type is underrepresented.\n"

Venue data retrieved from Foursquare will be further dissassembled to retrieve relevant information such as venue category types at different levels of precision. As an example, a restaurant of type \"Italian Restaurant\" can be more broadly categorized into \"Italian\" and even more generalized, be categorized as \"food\" (see figure 2 below)."
